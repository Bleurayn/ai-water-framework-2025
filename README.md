## Abstract

AI growth is driving massive data center water demand — estimated at 312–765 billion liters globally in 2025, with direct cooling often relying on potable sources in water-stressed regions.

This open-source framework models pathways to conserve drinkable water through three synergistic interventions:

- Rapid adoption of liquid and immersion cooling (zero/minimal evaporation)  
- Shift to non-potable and recycled water sources  
- Efficiency gains and dry cooling in suitable climates  

The model projects a **70% reduction in potable water demand by 2050** relative to business-as-usual, saving a mean **~12 trillion liters cumulatively** (2025–2050), despite continued AI expansion.

**Keywords:** AI sustainability, data center water use, potable water conservation, liquid cooling, immersion cooling, recycled water, climate impact, open-source modeling

## Introduction

As AI capabilities scale exponentially, so does the infrastructure supporting them. Data centers powering large models consume vast amounts of water — primarily for cooling, with a significant portion drawn from municipal/potable supplies.

While total water footprint grows, 2025 innovations (liquid/immersion cooling becoming standard, reclaimed water scaling) offer credible paths to decouple AI growth from potable water strain.

This framework quantifies plausible conservation trajectories, emphasizing transparency and policy-relevant scenarios.

## Framework Description

### Core Pathways

1. **Liquid/Immersion Cooling Adoption**  
   - S-curve ramp to 70% of new AI capacity by 2040  
   - Average 70% reduction in evaporative losses

2. **Non-Potable/Recycled Water Shift**  
   - Logistic growth to 80% of direct cooling needs by 2050

3. **Dry Cooling & Efficiency Bonus**  
   - 20% of facilities transition to zero-water systems

### Synergies
Early liquid cooling enables greater use of closed-loop/recycled systems; efficiency reduces overall demand.

## Methods

- Time horizon: 2025–2050
- Baseline: ~500 billion liters total AI-related water use in 2025 (~40% potable/direct)
- Growth: 25% annual to 2035, 10% thereafter
- Monte Carlo uncertainty (100 runs) on growth rates and adoption maxima
- Implementation: Python (NumPy, Matplotlib)

## Results

### Base Case Milestones
- 2030: ~300 billion liters potable saved annually
- 2040: ~600 billion liters annually
- 2050: ~850 billion liters annually  
- Cumulative savings: ~12 trillion liters

### Monte Carlo (2050 Mean)
- Cumulative potable savings: **12.0 ± 1.8 trillion liters**
